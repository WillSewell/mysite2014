title: Debugging MySQL replication lag by diving into the internals
description: >-
  In this post we investigate high replication lag in a MySQL database.
  In order to investigate it, it is helpful to dig into the replication
  internals, and that's what we do in this post. We look at the main
  processes and files used in the replication process as well as the
  different binary log formats and their pros and cons.
