title: Concurrency in Haskell presentation
---

I recently gave a presentation at Pusher on concurrency in Haskell. There
are a large number of libraries and techniques to choose between, and it is not
clear for new users which one is appropriate for their given use case. This
presentation should hopefully provide new Haskellers with a good overview.

Rather than focusing on *parallelism*, I just focus on the approaches to
*concurrent programming*; i.e. when you have to explicitly deal with threads.

So without further ado, [here are the slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hQ1H30bxDKAxFRhYprrOJb5Yj1A40IPewmqKflxrdts/edit?usp=sharing).
