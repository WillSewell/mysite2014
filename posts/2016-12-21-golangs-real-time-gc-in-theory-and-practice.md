title: Golang's Real-time GC in Theory and Practice
description: >-
  In this blog post, we'll look at Go's garbage collector. We'll see how
  it works (the tricolor algorithm), why it works (achieving such short GC
  pauses), and most importantly, whether it works (benchmarking these GC
  pauses, and comparing them with other languages).
