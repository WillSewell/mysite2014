title: Fuzz testing distributed systems with QuickCheck
description: >-
  I've recently been using QuickCheck to fuzz test our Raft implementation
  with some great results.

  In this blog post, I want to demonstrate how this is an an effective
  technique for testing distributed/concurrent systems, what makes it
  challenging and how you can do it yourself.
