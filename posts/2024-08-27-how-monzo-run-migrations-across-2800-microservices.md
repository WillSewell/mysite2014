title: "How Monzo run migrations across 2,800 microservices"
description: >-
  One of the challenges with a microservices architecture is that it's hard to

  Monzo's approach of centrally driven migrations helps us achieve consistent
  upgrades to libraries while minimising coordination overhead across the
  engineering organisation.
