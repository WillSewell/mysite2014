title: Porting the Pusher integration tests to Haskell
---

Over the last few months I have been writing blog posts for the Pusher blog. As I write them, I thought it would be worth linking to them here. Since I have mainly been using Haskell at Pusher, that will be the main focus of these posts. I am very passionate about the language, which is good, because that has been a strong motivator for me to actually write content!

So without further ado, here is the first blog post I wrote some months ago after I had completed my first introductory project at Pusher.

[Porting the Pusher integration tests to Haskell](https://blog.pusher.com/porting-the-pusher-integration-tests-to-haskell/)

Shortly I will link to a more recent -- and more technical -- post that I wrote up. In the future I will created a new post here as and when I write new ones -- I have a couple in the pipeline!
