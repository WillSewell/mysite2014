I have given talks which mainly focus on technologies I have been working with:
Haskell and Go. By chance, the primary focus has been on GC pause times in both
those languages; I find the topic fascinating, but it won't necessarily be the
focus of future talks.

If you would like me to give a talk, please get in touch.

## How Monzo migrated 2,800 microservices to OpenTelemetry

This talk shows how we at Monzo are able to run sweeping migrations across all
of our microservices. It covers the migrations principles as well as the tools
and technologies that make this possible. Since this was an Observability meetup,
I used our migration to
<a href="https://opentelemetry.io/" target="_blank">OpenTelemetry</a>
as a case study.

### At The London Observability Engineering Meetup (16th June 2022)

## How Monzo deploys to production 100 times a day

In this talk I show you how we at Monzo have optimised our engineering culture,
tooling, and architecture to make the path from idea to production as frictionless
as possible, all without sacrificing safety.

## Golang's realtime GC

I give this talk alongside [Jim Fisher](https://jameshfisher.com/). He
gives the initial, theoretical, half and I give the second half, which focuses
on empirical measurements.

for more detail.
