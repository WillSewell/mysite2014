title: Talks

I have given talks which mainly focus on technologies I have been working with:
Haskell and Go. By chance, the primary focus has been on GC pause times in both
those languages; I find the topic fascinating, but it won't necessarily be the
focus of future talks.

If you would like me to give a talk, [please get in touch](/contact.html).

## Golang's realtime GC

I give this talk alongside [Jim Fisher](https://jameshfisher.github.io/). He
gives the initial, theoretical, half and I give the second half, which focuses
on empirical measurements.

Check out the [source blog

for more detail.
