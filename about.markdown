Hi, I'm Will Sewell. I am a software engineer who is currently working at
[Pusher](https://pusher.com/). I am interested in Haskell (I work with it at
Pusher) as well as working on high performance network services, distributed
systems.

I recently completed an MPhil (masters) degree in Advanced Computer
Science at the [University of Cambridge](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/) where I
focused on the topics mentioned above, alongside more theoretical courses like
category theory/abstract algebra.

I occasionally blog here, but most of my posts are on the
[Pusher blog](https://blog.pusher.com/author/will/).
