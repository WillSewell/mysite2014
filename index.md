Hi, I'm Will Sewell. I am a software engineer who is currently working at
[Pusher](https://pusher.com/). My work is a mix between early stage product
development and maintenance of our [Channels](https://pusher.com/channels)
product. I'm a polyglot programmer who likes to use the right tool for the
job. At the moment that is Golang. I am interested in functional programming
languages, and have past experience with Haskell.

I like to write up my experience as [blog posts](https://making.pusher.com/) and
give [talks](talks.html). I also host [The Realtime Guild
meetup](https://www.meetup.com/the-realtime-guild/) in London where talks focus
on low latency systems from a range of technical domains.

Previously I did an MPhil (masters) degree in Advanced Computer Science at the
[University of Cambridge](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/) where I focused on the
topics mentioned above, alongside more theoretical courses like category
theory and abstract algebra.
