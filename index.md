Hi, I'm Will Sewell. I am a software engineer who is currently working at
[Pusher](https://pusher.com/). My interests include Haskell (I work with it at
Pusher) as well as working on high performance networked services and
distributed systems.

I recently completed an MPhil (masters) degree in Advanced Computer
Science at the [University of Cambridge](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/) where I
focused on the topics mentioned above, alongside more theoretical courses like
category theory/abstract algebra.
